## Agent Protocoll

- How can you "host" or run an agent?
- Do we enable locally hosted agents?

## Usage

- Is it only one task or is it chatting with an agent? That has impediments on the way the Protocoll needs to be defined.
- What are agents scenarios?

## Blockchain

- Using a underlying blockchain?
- Do **we** earn money on:
  - every transaction
  - by staking
  - own cryptocurrency


## Price-Model

- When to use fix-fees and when to use shares? Depending on the type of agent?
